// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

// 1. Planning
// 2. Analysis of Requirements 
// 3. Design 
// 4. Implementation 
// 5. Testing and Integration 
// 6. Maintain 


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "The second step, where software is carefully analyzed to determine what is required to reach the end goal"

const design = "In this third step, after planning and determining what is required for the build of the software it is designed by the team"

const implementation = "In this step, the design is implemented"

const testingAndItegration = "after the design is implemented it must be tested to make sure operations run smoothly and as planned"

const maintain = "this last step is very important because regular maintenance is required to ensure the software stays running as it should and bugs are fixed when needed"
